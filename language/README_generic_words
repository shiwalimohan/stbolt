The link grammar dictionaries have been augmented with generic placeholder words, to be used when
integrated with Soar. Each type having its own file has 20 generics. For instances, words.n.1 has
generic-word.n.1[0] through generic-word.n.1[19]. 

These are the decriptions of the word classes, from the LG documentation:

words.n.1		singular countable (i.e. not mass) nouns
words.n.2.s		plural nouns ending in "s"
words.n.2.x		plural nouns not ending in "s"
words.n.3		mass nouns
words.n.4		nouns that may be mass or countable
words.n.p		proper names that are also ordinary words when not capitalized (see Section 3.1 for explanation)
words.n.t		nouns that can be used as titles, like "president"

    (In the following verb files, the final number indicates the verb form. ".1" is for infinitive-plural forms, ".2" is for singular forms, ".3" is for simple-past / past-participle forms, ".4" is for present participles, ".5" is for gerunds. On intransitive verbs, the present participle and gerund expression are combined into a single dictionary entry.)
