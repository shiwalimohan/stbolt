# examine the words before parsing, possibly swapping them out based on Soar
# knowledge.
# Soar knowledge to mess with the sentence before the parser sees it goes here.
# Learned words will be looked up in semantic memory here, and replaced with
# generics. Possibly all words.

# Other potential uses: if context/knowledge tells us a word should get a different
# dictionary entry than LG would normally use. Need a good example that can't
# be better handled by selecting non-default parses in evaluate-parse..

# For now (5/2012), this is just a placeholder.

# preprocessing flow:
# -sentence appears on io.input-link.lg.original-sentence
#  structure: sentence.words.word [wvalue wcount]
# -preprocessing goal takes over, builds io.output-link.preprocessed-sentence
#  structure: preprocessed-sentence.start [word next] [word next] ..
