Go to file->import existing projects, point it at this directory to import the lgsoar project.

Go to lgsoar project properties->Java Build Path->Libraries->Add External JARs, add these:
[SoarSuite path]/share/java/sml.jar
[SoarSuite path]/share/java/soar-debugger(version).jar

Also in Java Build Path->Libraries, do Add Library.. and choose JRE system library (workspace default)

Also in Java Build Path, Source tab:
remove lgsoar
add lgsoar/src

add a run config:
-arguments should be a single quoted sentence
-on Linux, environment tab needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to the SoarSuite lib directory
-on OS X, this is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
-on Windows, ???
(the right way to do this is supposed to be to go through the External JARs settings (above), expand the JAR, and add a native library location to the two Soar JARs, but that doesn't work for me)
