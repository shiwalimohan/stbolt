/**
 * The classes in this package enable graphical output representing the processing of XNL-Soar, 
 * such as syntactic trees or LCS graphs.<p/>
 * In the current implementation, we do not use the GraphViz class; instead, we use perl and the 
 * <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lbrocard/GraphViz-2.04/lib/GraphViz.pm">perl GraphViz</a> package,
 * which is called via some of the RHS functions provided in {@link GraphUtils}. <p/>
 * In order for graphing to work, make sure that you have both of those installed, along with the 
 * <a href="www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> binaries.
