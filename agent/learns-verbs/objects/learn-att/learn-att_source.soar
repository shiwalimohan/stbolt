# learn-att - Handles when the top segment has a learning-event for an attribute

source propose*learn-att.soar
# Proposes learn-att when the top segment on the interaction stack has the purpose of learning an attribute
# segment.purpose <p>
# (<p> ^type learn-att
#	   ^parameters.internal <internal-att>
#	   ^parameters.external <external-att>)

# Causes Soar to enter a substate

source elaborations.soar
# Elaborates the substate with the useful information regarding the attributes to be learned

source preferences.soar
# Enforces the following order of operators in the substate:

	source learn-val.soar
	# First learns any values that it can make a match with (another segment will be pushed and popped)
	
	source store-att.soar
	# Then stores the attribute mapping in semantic memory

	source update-objects.soar
	# Then updates the objects with the new mapping

	source complete-learn-att.soar
	# Finally exits the substate by marking the satisfaction complete on the top state
