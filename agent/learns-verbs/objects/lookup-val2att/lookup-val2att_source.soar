# Looks up an attribute from smem based on the value
#   These are for external representations
# Propose the following operator:
#	<s> ^operator <o>
#	<o> ^name lookup-att2val
#		^value <external-val>
#       ^attribute <external-att>
# NOTE: you should only specify the ^value WME
# If successful, adds ^attribute <word> to the operator
# If failure, adds ^attribute failure to the operator

source elaborations.soar
# copies the value onto the substate

source smem-val2att-query.soar
# smem-val-query
#   Queries smem for the matching value

source complete-lookup-val2att.soar
# Fetches the query result and adds the result to the superstate lookup-val operator
# If successful, adds the found word to the operator
# If failure, adds the word 'failure' to the operator
# Example for trying to find an external value color
#	 Success: adds ^external color, Failure: adds ^external failure
