# learn-att - Handles when the top segment has a learning-event for an attribute

source propose*learn-val2att.soar
# Proposes learn-val2att when the top segment on the interaction stack has 
# the purpose of learning a value to attribute matching
# segment.purpose <p>
# (<p> ^type learn-val2att
#	   ^parameters.attribute <external-att>

# Causes Soar to enter a substate

source elaborations.soar
# Elaborates the substate with the useful information regarding the attributes to be learned

source preferences.soar
# Enforces the following order of operators in the substate:

	source lookup-att.soar
	# First lookups up the matcing internal attribute to see if its known

	source learn-val.soar
	# Next learns any values that it can make a match with (another segment will be pushed and popped)
	
	source store-val2att.soar
	# Then stores the value to attribute mapping in semantic memory

	source complete-learn-val2att.soar
	# Finally exits the substate by marking the satisfaction complete on the top state
