### dialog events from the instructor will have different purposes.
### the agent uses background knowledge of interactive dialog to assign purpose to instructor-messages.


 ## case 1 verb-commands: the purpose of the instructor is for the agent to act the command in the environment.

 sp {elaborate*instructor-message*purpose*case1
    (state <s> ^topstate <s>
	       ^instructor-message <m>)
    (<m> ^event-type verb-command)
 -->
    (<m> ^purpose <p>)
    (<p> ^type environmental-action
	 ^assigned-to agent)
 }


 ### case 2 indication of a successful completion: the purpose of the instructor is to indicate that the current action being pursued is successfully completed, and hence an explanation of that composite operator is in order

 sp {elaborate*instructor-message*purpose*case2
    (state <s> ^topstate <s>
	       ^instructor-message <m>)
    (<m> ^event-type successful-completion)
 -->
    (<m> ^purpose <p>)
    (<p> ^type explanation
	 ^assigned-to agent)
 }


 ### case 3 question regarding the state of the agent: the purpose of the instructor is to acquire some knowledge about the state of the agent.


sp {elaborate*instructor-message*purpose*case3
   (state <s> ^topstate <s>
   	      ^instructor-message <m>)
   (<m> ^event-type question-fact)
-->
   (<m> ^purpose <p>)
   (<p> ^type get-fact)
