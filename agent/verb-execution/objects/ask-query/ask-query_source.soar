# ask-query
#	If there is a query structure on the top state and no current-query
#		this operator will ask the query by creating a structure on the output link

source ask-query.soar
#	proposes ask-query if there is a query on the top state and 
#		it is an appropriate time to ask a question (no current-query)
                                               
#   ask-query is proposed for each query
#		then each operator is elaborated with the structure that should go on the output link
#	Preferences determine which queries are better than others
#	When an ask-query operator is chosen, it adds the query structure to the output link 
#		and creates a current-query structure
