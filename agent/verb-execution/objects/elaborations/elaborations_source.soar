source unique.soar
# Adds a unique flag to each object if its description can uniquely identify it from the other objects

source object-description.soar
# Creates the descriptions of the object, both internal and external
# (<obj> ^desc <desc> and <obj> ^external-desc <desc>)
# The internal description is the one used for internal reasoning
# The external description is what would go on the output link to refer to the object

source att-and-val-types.soar
# Inside an object's mapping, adds labels to the att-val-pair.att and att-val-pair.val identifiers
# Adds either ^att-type or ^val-type, which can take on the following values:
#	unknown - no internal or external symbols
#	internal - only the internal symbol
#	external - only the external symbol
#	matched - both the internal and external symbols


#source object-names.soar
# Manually adds names for testing purposes only
