# Looks up an attribute from smem
#	You can lookup by external or by internal representation
# Propose the following operator:
#	<s> ^operator <o>
#	<o> ^name lookup-att
#		^internal <internal-att>
#		^external <external-att>
# NOTE: you should only have one of the above ^internal or ^external attributes
#		leaving one off the operator denotes which you are looking for
# If successful, adds ^external <word> or ^internal <word> to the operator
# If failure, adds ^external failure or ^internal failure to the operator

source elaborations.soar
# creates the query structure on the substate
# query has 2 attributes, internal and external
# by leaving one off the lookup-att operator it will cause that one to be
#	searched for in smem

source smem-att-query.soar
# smem-att-query
#   Queries smem for the matching attribute

source complete-lookup-att.soar
# Fetches the query result and adds the result to the superstate lookup-att operator
# If successful, adds the found word to the operator
# If failure, adds the word 'failure' to the operator
# Example for trying to find an external attribute color
#	 Success: adds ^external color, Failure: adds ^external failure
