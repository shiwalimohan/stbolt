# Looks up a value from smem
#	You can lookup by external or by internal representation
# Propose the following operator:
#	<s> ^operator <o>
#	<o> ^name lookup-val
#		^internal <internal-val>
#		^external <external-val>
# NOTE: you should only have one of the above ^internal or ^external values
#		leaving one off the operator denotes which you are looking for
# If successful, adds ^external <word> or ^internal <word> to the operator
# If failure, adds ^external failure or ^internal failure to the operator

source elaborations.soar
# creates the query structure on the substate
# query has 2 values, internal and external
# by leaving one off the lookup-val operator it will cause that one to be
#	searched for in smem

source smem-val-query.soar
# smem-val-query
#   Queries smem for the matching value

source complete-lookup-val.soar
# Fetches the query result and adds the result to the superstate lookup-val operator
# If successful, adds the found word to the operator
# If failure, adds the word 'failure' to the operator
# Example for trying to find an external value color
#	 Success: adds ^external color, Failure: adds ^external failure
