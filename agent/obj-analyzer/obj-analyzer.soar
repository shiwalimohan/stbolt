source init-obj-analyzer.soar
# Initializes obj-analyzer and adds knowledge to semantic memory

source wait.soar
# Basic wait operator when no operators are proposed


source remove-stored.soar
# Automatically removes store commands to smem


pushd ask-query
 source ask-query_source.soar
#	If there is a query structure on the top state and no current-query
#		this operator will ask the query by creating a structure on the output link

popd


pushd create-object
source create-object_source.soar
#	When an object comes in on the input link this operator
#		creates a working memory representation of that object
#	It also uses semantic memory to match internal terms for attributes and values
#		to external words if it has that knowledge

pushd process-message
source process-message_source.soar
# When a new message is recieved it proposes process-message to handle it
#	Based on the type of message expected different operators will handle it

pushd lookup-att
source lookup-att_source.soar
# Looks up an attribute from smem
#	You can lookup by external or by internal representation
# Propose the following operator:
#	<s> ^operator <o>
#	<o> ^name lookup-att
#		^internal <internal-att>
#		^external <external-att>
# NOTE: you should only have one of the above ^internal or ^external attributes
#		leaving one off the operator denotes which you are looking for
# If successful, adds ^external <word> or ^internal <word> to the operator
# If failure, adds ^external failure or ^internal failure to the operator
popd

pushd lookup-val
source lookup-val_source.soar
# Looks up a value from smem
#	You can lookup by external or by internal representation
# Propose the following operator:
#	<s> ^operator <o>
#	<o> ^name lookup-val
#		^internal <internal-val>
#		^external <external-val>
# NOTE: you should only have one of the above ^internal or ^external values
#		leaving one off the operator denotes which you are looking for
# If successful, adds ^external <word> or ^internal <word> to the operator
# If failure, adds ^external failure or ^internal failure to the operator
