instructor/mentor and converts it into a Soar readable parse
(described in the MIISI document). The grammar (in MIISI) is only
partially implemented. 

* Dictionary

Following grammar is supported by this package. Typical regex
operators apply.

: SEN => VBC | GS | REL | PS

: PS => VBC if (REL)*
: VBC => (VB) | (VB OBJ) | (VB OBJ PP OBJ)
: REL => OBJ is PP OBJ
: OBJ => DT? JJ* NN
